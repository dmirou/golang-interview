Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] is the longest contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: [0, 1] (or [1, 0]) is a longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0]
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,0] is the longest contiguous subarray with equal number of 0 and 1.

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
